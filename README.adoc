IMPORTANT: This repository contains an old client library implementation. Different .NET client libraries have been harmonized and current versions can be found in https://github.com/10Duke/10duke-dotnet-client[this repository].

== .NET desktop application client library for the 10Duke Entitlement service

Client library for .NET desktop applications, for using services of the 10Duke Entitlement. Main features are:

* OAuth 2.0 authorization / sign-on using an embedded browser. Since the 10Duke Entitlement service provides identity-based entitlement services, the OAuth process establishes both authorization for the client application and the user identity.
* Checking and consuming licenses
* Releasing consumed licenses
* Checking end-user permissions

=== CefSharp embedded browser and Any CPU support

The embedded browser used for sign-on and OAuth 2.0 authorization is implemented with https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp[CefSharp]. The implementation supports the +Any CPU+ platform, and CefSharp platform dependent resources must be made available in an application that uses this client library. See more about https://github.com/cefsharp/CefSharp/issues/1714[CefSharp AnyCPU support]. The easiest way to make the CefSharp resources available is to use NuGet for adding a reference to CefSharp in the application.

=== Basic usage

Class +Tenduke.EntitlementClient.EntClient+ implements the 10Duke Entitlement service client. This chapter introduces configuration and features of +Tenduke.EntitlementClient.EntClient+.

==== EntClient configuration

Class +Tenduke.EntitlementClient.Config.AuthorizationCodeGrantConfig+ is used for configuring OAuth 2.0 access.

.Basic OAuth 2.0 configuration for the client
[source,csharp]
----
var oauthConfig = new Tenduke.EntitlementClient.Config.AuthorizationCodeGrantConfig()
{
    AuthzUri = "https://10duke-ent.example.com/oauth2/authz/",
    TokenUri = "https://10duke-ent.example.com/oauth2/access/",
    ClientID = "MyApp",
    ClientSecret = "verysecret",
    RedirectUri = "oob:MyApp",
    Scope = "openid profile email",
    SignerKey = EntServiceRsaPublicKey
}
var entClient = new EntClient()  { OAuthConfig = oauthConfig };
----

Value of the +SignerKey+ property is an instance of the +System.Security.Cryptography.RSA+ class, describing an RSA public key for verifying signatures of tokens received from the 10Duke Entitlement service.

For basic usage with defaults, this OAuth configuration is sufficient for starting to use the client.

==== Application-wide static initialization and cleanup

When an application using this client library is started, it must call one of the static +Initialize+ methods of class +Tenduke.EntitlementClient.EntClient+. This is necessary for initializing +CefSharp+.

.Static initialization with defaults
[source,csharp]
----
EntClient.Initialize();
----

The code above calls the zero-argument +Initialize+ method, initializing +CefSharp+ with default settings. With these default settings, the +CefSharp+ platform dependent resources must be available in +x86+ and +x64+ subdirectories of the directory of your application (the directory of the application exe file).

For specifying another base directory instead of the application base directory, the another +Initialize+ overload can be used:

.Static initialization with custom CefSharp resources base directory
[source,csharp]
----
var cefSharpResolverArgs = new Tenduke.EntitlementClient.Util.CefSharpResolverArgs()
{
    BaseDir = "custom/base/dir"
}
EntClient.Initialize(cefSharpResolverArgs);
----

One of these +Initialize+ overloads must be called once in the lifecycle of your application, before instantiating and using an instance of +Tenduke.EntitlementClient.EntClient+ for the first time.

Respectively, when your application is shutting down or is not going to use +Tenduke.EntitlementClient.EntClient+ anymore, the static +Shutdown+ method must be called.

.Static clean-up
[source,csharp]
----
EntClient.Shutdown();
----

==== OAuth 2.0 authorization and user sign-on

An instance of +Tenduke.EntitlementClient.EntClient+ must first authenticate user and obtain OAuth authorization. This is done by calling +AuthorizeSync+ that opens a modal form that allows user to log in. The form uses an embedded browser for displaying login screen from the server.

.User sign-on and OAuth 2.0 authorization
[source,csharp]
----
var entClient = new EntClient()  { ... EntClient configurations ... };
entClient.AuthorizeSync();
if (entClient.IsAuthorized())
{
    // Success, the EntClient instance is ready to use
}
else
{
   // The login form was closed by the user, login and OAuth authorization not completed
}
----

==== Consuming licenses

Licenses can be checked, consumed and released using the +AuthzApi+ property of a +Tenduke.EntitlementClient.EntClient+ instance with successful authorization. The +CheckOrConsume+ method can be used for consuming licenses.

.Checking out (consuming) a license
[source,csharp]
----
var entClient = ... an EntClient instance with successful authorization ...;

// Name of the license to consume
string licenseToCheck = "CoolLicensedFeature";
// I want a license token response, in JWT format. The response will
// be parsed and token signature will be verified automatically.
Tenduke.EntitlementClient.EntApi.ResponseType responseType = Tenduke.EntitlementClient.EntApi.ResponseType.JWT;
// I want to start using the licensed feature, i.e. check out the license
bool consume = true;

Tenduke.EntitlementClient.EntApi.Authz.AuthorizationDecision response = await entClient.AuthzApi.CheckOrConsumeAsync(licenseToCheck, responseType, consume);

// The AuthorizationDecision response object describes success of the
// request with metadata. Basic success check example below:
bool success = response[licenseToCheck];
// The jti response attribute can be used later for releasing the checked
// out license
string checkOutId = response["jti"];
----

A consumed (checked out) license can be released by calling +ReleaseLicense+.

.Checking out (consuming) a license
[source,csharp]
----
var entClient = ... an EntClient instance with successful authorization ...;
string checkOutId = ... value of jti response attribute from calling CheckOrConsume ...;

Tenduke.EntitlementClient.EntApi.ResponseType responseType = Tenduke.EntitlementClient.EntApi.ResponseType.JWT;

Tenduke.EntitlementClient.EntApi.Authz.AuthorizationDecision response = await entClient.AuthzApi.ReleaseLicenseAsync(checkOutId, responseType);
