== Sample application

This is a C# / Windows Forms sample application using the 10Duke Entitlement client library.

When starting the application, the application launches a sign-on process in an embedded browser window. If this window is closed and the process is interrupted, the sample application exits. In order for this process to work, the sample application must be configured correctly. The configuration settings are documented below.

After a successfully completed sign-on process, UI of the sample application allows making licensing requests againts the 10Duke Entitlement service.

=== Configuration settings

After building the application, the output file +SampleApp.exe.config+ will contain example configuration settings in the +SampleApp.Properties.Settings+ configuration section. Configuration can be amended by changing these settings.
